Crowdcontrol enables you to engage multiple members of your organization to participate in your bug bounty programs. You can [invite new users](doc:adding-members-at-the-program-level) and [assign roles](doc:adjusting-or-removing-user-roles) to them based on the tasks you want them to perform. For example, you can provide a team member with an administrative access level to pay out rewards or you can grant them basic access level to simply view submissions. You can perform all team member management tasks on an **Organization Level** in the `Organization Settings` or on a **Program Level** in the `Program Settings`.
